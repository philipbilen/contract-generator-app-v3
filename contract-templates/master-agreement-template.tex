% ================= 3. GRANT OF RIGHTS =================
\section*{3. GRANT OF RIGHTS (EXCLUSIVE LICENCE)}

\clause{3.1}{Exclusive Licence}
The Artist grants the Label the exclusive right, during the Term and throughout the Territory, to exploit the Master~(s) for digital audio and audiovisual distribution and to authorize the Distribution Partner to do the same. This includes downloads, streams, and use on user-generated content platforms.

\clause{3.2}{Included Rights}
The grant includes the rights to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, and make available the Master~(s); to create and use reasonable edits and clips for promotion; and to use the Artist's name~(s) and approved likenesses/biographies in connection with marketing the Master~(s).

All rights not expressly granted are reserved to the Artist, including all rights in the Composition~(s).

% ================= 4. TERM AND TERRITORY =================
\section*{4. TERM AND TERRITORY}

\clause{4.1}{Term}
The Term of this licence shall be as defined in Section~2.

\clause{4.2}{Territory}
The Territory shall be as defined in Section~2.

% ================= 5. FINANCIAL TERMS =================
\section*{5. FINANCIAL TERMS}

\clause{5.1}{Payment Flow}
DSPs pay ADA;\ ADA pays the Distribution Partner; the Distribution Partner deducts its \distroFee\ fee from Net Royalty Receipts to calculate NetToCompany.

\clause{5.2}{Splits}
NetToCompany is divided into the Label Share and the Artist Share as specified in Schedule~A.

\clause{5.3}{Direct Pay Model}
The Distribution Partner pays Artist-side Licensors directly based on the details they provide. The Label receives its Label Share directly. The Label does not collect or distribute the Artist Share and is not liable for payment delays by the Distribution Partner.

\clause{5.4}{Accounting Schedule}
Payments and statements follow the Distribution Partner's schedule, which is currently semi-annual (April/October) with a USD~100 minimum payment threshold.

\clause{5.5}{No Recoupment by Label}
The Label will provide cover artwork and Spotify canvas free of charge, and these costs are not recoupable against the Artist Share.

\clause{5.6}{Neighbouring Rights}
For the Label's share of neighbouring rights income, the Distribution Partner retains 50\% of net receipts and pays the balance to the Label. Performers must claim their share directly from their respective societies.

\clause{5.7}{Third-Party Licences (Sync)}
For sync licences arranged by the Distribution Partner, it retains 40\% of its net income. The balance flows into NetToCompany for splitting per Section~5.2.

\clause{5.8}{Taxes}
Each party is responsible for its own taxes.

\clause{5.9}{Assigned Slices; Direct Pay}
If any Licensor assigns or directs a portion of their Artist Share to a third party (e.g.,\ management or collaborator), and such party is listed as a Licensor in Schedule~A, the Distribution Partner shall pay that portion \emph{directly} to the assignee under the Direct Pay Model. The Label has no responsibility for distributing Artist Share amounts between Licensors.

% ================= 6. DELIVERY & ACCEPTANCE =================
\section*{6. DELIVERY \& ACCEPTANCE}

\clause{6.1}{Artist Deliverables}
The Artist will deliver all required assets at no charge, including: final audio files (WAV), complete and accurate metadata, a signed Master Split Sheet, and contact details for all Licensors for royalty statements. The Label will be responsible for creating and delivering artwork.

\clause{6.2}{Distributor Onboarding}
For actual payment, each Licensor must complete the Distribution Partner's separate payee onboarding and invoice template (providing banking/tax details). The Label does not handle this data.

\clause{6.3}{Quality Control}
The Label may reject materials that do not meet technical, legal, or DSP style guide requirements, and will provide written reasons. The Artist will have 10 business days to cure any defects.

% ================= 7. CREDITS =================
\section*{7. CREDITS}

\clause{7.1}{Roles}
Credits must use standard industry roles. ``Display Roles'' (Primary Artist, Featured Artist, Remixer) determine the artist line on DSPs.

\clause{7.2}{Moral Rights}
The Label will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure accurate crediting in metadata provided to DSPs.

% ================= 8. MARKETING \& APPROVALS =================
\section*{8. MARKETING \& APPROVALS}

\clause{8.1}{Artwork Process}
The Label shall create the official cover artwork for the Master~(s) in a collaborative process with the Artist.

The Artist is encouraged to provide input, concepts, and wishes (``Creative Input'') to guide the creative process.

\clause{8.2}{Standard Timeline}
For releases scheduled more than three (3) weeks in advance:
\begin{enumerate}[label=~(\alph*)]
\item \textbf{Consultation:} The Label's visual team will consult with the Artist on the initial Creative Input.
\item \textbf{Drafts \& Revisions:} The Label will provide the Artist with at least one (1) draft for review. The Artist is entitled to one (1) round of reasonable revisions.

\item \textbf{Final Version:} The Label will provide a final or near-final artwork version for approval.
\item \textbf{Limited Adjustments:} Artist feedback will be restricted to minor adjustments only (e.g.,\ text edits, typographical corrections, minor colour shifts). No substantial redesigns will be undertaken at this stage.
\end{enumerate}

\clause{8.4}{Final Approval}
Final written approval from the Artist is required for all artwork. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, particularly if the artwork aligns with the Artist's initial Creative Input (if any), the Label's brand identity, and the applicable process. If the Artist does not provide written objections within three (3) business days of receiving the final version for approval, the artwork shall be deemed approved.

\clause{8.5}{Promotional Use}

Each Artist shall be solely responsible for any and all other payments, fees, or sums due to any party engaged by them in connection with the creation of the Master~(s) (including but not limited to producers, musicians, or vocalists paid on a flat-fee or other non-royalty basis).
\end{enumerate}

\clause{9.2}{Indemnity}
The Artist will indemnify and hold the Label, its licensees, and its distribution partners harmless from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from any breach of the warranties, representations, or covenants made in Section~9.1.

\clause{9.3}{Takedown Right}
Upon notice of a credible claim of infringement or a breach of warranty, the Label shall have the right, without limiting its other rights, to temporarily take down the affected Master~(s) from all platforms while the issue is being resolved by the Artist.

% ================= 12. TERMINATION AND REVERSION =================
\section*{12. TERMINATION AND REVERSION OF RIGHTS}

\clause{12.1}{Artist's Right to Terminate for Inactivity}
Notwithstanding the perpetual Term, the Artist may terminate the licence for a specific Master by providing the Label with written notice if said Master has been unavailable on all major digital service providers (DSPs) for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days for reasons solely within the Label's or its Distribution Partner's direct control.
